To illustrate this point, the images in figure 3a are all generated by randomly selecting colors for each pixel. The implication is that the vast majority of this space is without either structure or appeal. Particularly in evolutionary computation, significant research in recent years has sought to clarify how complex structures can be encoded most efficiently for evolutionary search (Bentley and Kumar, 1999; Hornby and Pollack, 2002; Stanley and Miikkulainen, 2004a, 2003; Angeline, 1995; Hart et al., 1994; Bongard and Pfeifer, 2001). It is now widely recognized that a good encoding allows information in the genotype to be reused in producing the phenotype (Gruau et al., 1996; Hart et al., 1994). Encodings with this property are called indirect encodings (Stanley and Miikkulainen, 2003). Human DNA, for instance, functions through an indirect encoding, mapping only about 30,000 genes to a body with trillions of cells and 100 trillion neural connections (Zigmond et al., 1999). It turns out that CPPNs are an indirect encoding with several powerful representational properties that make them particularly suited to encoding and searching for spatial patterns. In particular, they are designed to efficiently encode repetition, repetition with variation, symmetry, and elaboration.
